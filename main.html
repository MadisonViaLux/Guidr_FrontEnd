                        on as constructive home work for the week. This question
                        of "Who are we?" is answered by taking a look at the Portfolio 
                        page, because that's the purpose of that page, not this one.
                        This page and content there of, is graded by creativity. So 
                        for that purpose, here's a winky face. ;)
